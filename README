This is a stopwatch. It's very straightforward, so this file will mostly be used to keep track of planned future features.

UP NEXT:
-I like the minimal look but it is a *little bit* ugly. I would like to make it fancier and possibly add support for color theming.
FUTURE:
-Keep track of fastest and slowest laps.
-Possibly add other "normal web app clock" features? Like a timer? The sky is the limit, I suppose.
