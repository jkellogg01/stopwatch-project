# Stopwatch

## Description

This is a single-page stopwatch app I created as an exercise in design and in web development in general. It will be periodically updated as I learn and grow, but I suspect I might outgrow it too.


## Installation

## Usage

Use it as a stopwatch, perhaps? Make sure your band's set list is the tight 30 that you promised the venue. Get that 4-minute mile under control. Maybe make sure it stays accurate, because I've tested that it does in the past but who's to say how long that will hold up.
