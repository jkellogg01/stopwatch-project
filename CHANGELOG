06 JUN 2023 - 20:26 - Version 2, I suppose?
- The stopwatch works now.
06 JUN 2023 - 20:46 - Version 3
- Laps now display how long the lap was instead of the time at which they ended, as you might expect from a stopwatch.
06 JUN 2023 - 23:22 - Version 4
- Reformatted changelog to be even more pretentious
- Stopwatch is now sexy. Please do not lewd the stopwatch.
- Safari appears to not get along with the current iteration. Investigating.
07 JUN 2023 - 00:06 - Version 4a
- Made a change that will hopefully resolve the safari display issues. I am tired and don't have safari on the machine I'm working on so I'm going to bed and I'll find out if the problem has been resolved tomorrow.
- It still doesn't work on safari. I'll do some research tomorrow but if by some cosmic grace you're reading this and know why this doesn't work on safari at the moment I would greatly appreciate your input.
07 JUN 2023 - 10:40 - Version 5
- Main vertical layout no longer uses flexbox, in a final effort to try and fix the safari compatibility issues.
- Time display cluster now sticks to the top of the page, in case you are generating enough laps to require scrolling through them. Good luck on your marathon or whatever.
